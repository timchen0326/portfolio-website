Key metrics include: - Poll Quality: Measures like pollster rating and transparency scores. - Sample Characteristics: Sample sizes, methods (e.g., live phone interviews, online panels), and temporal trends. - State-Level Data: Focused polling in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.\n\n\nAnalytical Approach\n\nRegression Models: Linear and multiple linear regressions were used to assess factors affecting voter support for each candidate.\nAddressing Bias: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis eliminated multicollinearity issues in predictors.\nPredictive Accuracy: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was used to evaluate model performance on test data."

I am deeply passionate about solving practical problems using statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques.\nDuring my academic journey, I have completed advanced coursework in fields like Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Statistical Theory, and Software Design. These studies have equipped me with a strong foundation in data-driven methodologies and programming.\nI have professional experience as a Frontend Software Engineer Intern at MAYOHR, where I worked with TypeScript, React, and RESTful APIs to develop features that improved user efficiency. Additionally, I utilized Python for frontend testing, streamlining integration and enhancing overall troubleshooting processes.\nMy project portfolio includes an analysis of Toronto crime patterns using Bayesian logistic regression, developing an app for managing NBA statistics with Java and Python, and forecasting U.S. presidential election results using regression models. I also conducted a detailed examination of shelter trends in Toronto, highlighting key seasonal demands.\nI am proficient in Python, SQL, R, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Java, with experience using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Quarto. I hold the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, underscoring my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Beyond technical skills, I have honed my organizational and problem-solving abilities through leadership roles and collaborative projects."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the Winter 2025 CSC311 Machine Learning Challenge, our team undertook the task of building a classifier to predict which food item a survey respondent described based on their subjective responses. The challenge consisted of four components: data collection, team formation, model prediction, and the final report (# Table 1 in the challenge instructions).\n\n\nData and Preprocessing\nWe received a CSV file containing survey responses regarding food complexity, ingredient count, serving context, price expectation, movie association, drink pairing, personal associations, and hot-sauce preference. The raw data was cleaned and standardized using custom functions to handle numeric parsing (e.g., converting word descriptors to numbers), free-text normalization, and multi-hot encoding of checkbox responses. Numerical features (ingredient count, price) were binned into quintiles, while categorical and multi-select features were one-hot or multi-hot encoded to produce a high-dimensional feature matrix (see feature_config.json).\n\n\nModel Development\nOur team explored three families of models:\n\nDecision Tree Classifier: Tuned parameters such as splitting criterion, tree depth, and cost-complexity pruning. Achieved ~85% cross-validation accuracy after grid search on parameters like max_depth and ccp_alpha.\nMulticlass Logistic Regression: Applied multinomial logistic regression with L1 and L2 regularization. The best configuration (L1, C = 1.0) yielded ~88% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy.\nMultinomial Naïve Bayes: Manual implementation with Laplace smoothing (α = 1.0) on discretized features, which excelled on high-dimensional, sparse input and achieved ~90% cross-validation accuracy.\n\nAfter systematic evaluation, we selected Multinomial Naïve Bayes as the final model due to its robust performance (average CV accuracy = 0.9002) and efficiency with sparse feature vectors.\n\n\nFinal Model and Performance\nThe final model was implemented in predict_local.py, which includes preprocessing, feature alignment, and posterior computations to output the predicted class for each test instance. On the official unseen test set (compiled from TA and instructor responses), we achieved an accuracy of 87%. Our professor awarded our team a certification for outstanding performance in this challenge.\n\n\nDeployment\nBuilding on the project codebase, I individually deployed the trained Naïve Bayes classifier within a Streamlit application for interactive use. The app allows users to input survey responses via sidebar widgets and instantly receive food-item predictions. You can explore the live app here:\nFood-Item Classifier Streamlit App\nBelow is the Streamlit application entry point (app.py):\nimport streamlit as st\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nfrom predict_local import preprocess_raw_data, predict_all\n\n# (See full code in `app.py` in the repository.)\n\n\nConclusion\nThe CSC311 ML Challenge provided an opportunity to apply end-to-end machine learning practices, from data cleaning and feature engineering to model selection, tuning, and deployment. Achieving 87% accuracy and receiving certification from our professor validated our approach. The live Streamlit app demonstrates the practical utility of the classifier, making the project accessible to end users."
